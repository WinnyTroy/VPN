# VPN  
-  VPN is a private network that uses a public network (usually the Internet) to connect remote sites or users together.   
 

Background Info:  
- Until recently, reliable communication has meant the use of leased lines to maintain a wide-area network (WAN).   
- A WAN has obvious advantages over a public network like the Internet when it comes to reliability, performance, and security; but maintaining a WAN, particularly when using leased lines, can become quite expensive (it often rises in cost as the distance between the offices increases). Additionally, leased lines are not a viable solution for organizations where part of the work force is highly mobile (as is the case with the marketing staff) and might frequently need to connect to the corporate network remotely and access sensitive data.  
- As the popularity of the Internet has grown, businesses have turned to it as a means of extending their own networks. First came intranets, which are sites designed for use only by company employees. Now, many companies create their own Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to accommodate the needs of remote employees and distant offices.  
- Instead of using a dedicated, real-world connection, such as leased line, a VPN uses "virtual" connections routed through the Internet from the company's private network to the remote site or employee.  
-  What Makes a VPN?

There are two common types of VPNs.  

    Remote-Access—  Also called a Virtual Private Dial-up Network (VPDN), this is a user-to-LAN connection used by a company that has employees who need to connect to the private network from various remote locations. Typically, a corporation that wishes to set up a large remote-access VPN provides some form of Internet dial-up account to their users using an Internet service provider (ISP). The telecommuters can then dial a 1-800 number to reach the Internet and use their VPN client software to access the corporate network. A good example of a company that needs a remote-access VPN would be a large firm with hundreds of sales people in the field. Remote-access VPNs permit secure, encrypted connections between a company's private network and remote users through a third-party service provider.  
    
    Site-to-Site—  Through the use of dedicated equipment and large-scale encryption, a company can connect multiple fixed sites over a public network such as the Internet. Each site needs only a local connection to the same public network, thereby saving money on long private leased-lines. Site-to-site VPNs can be further categorized into intranets or extranets. A site-to-site VPN built between offices of the same company is said to be an intranet VPN, while a VPN built to connect the company to its partner or customer is referred to as an extranet VPN.

A well-designed VPN can greatly benefit a company. For example, it can:

    Extend geographic connectivity

    Reduce operational costs versus traditional WANs

    Reduce transit times and traveling costs for remote users

    Improve productivity

    Simplify network topology

    Provide global networking opportunities

    Provide telecommuter support

    Provide faster Return On Investment (ROI) than traditional WAN

What features are needed in a well-designed VPN? It should incorporate these items:

    Security

    Reliability

    Scalability

    Network Management

    Policy Management
